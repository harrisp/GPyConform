## v0.1.0 (21/10/2024) - Initial Release

ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the first release of [GPyConform](https://github.com/harrisp/GPyConform)! **GPyConform** extends the [GPyTorch](https://gpytorch.ai) library by implementing (Full) Conformal Prediction for Gaussian Process Regression.

### Features
- **Provably Valid Prediction Intervals**: Provides Prediction Intervals with guaranteed coverage under minimal assumptions (data exchangeability).
- **Full Utilization of GPyTorch**: Leverages the robust and efficient GP modeling capabilities of GPyTorch.
- **Supports Both Symmetric and Asymmetric Prediction Intervals**: Implements both the symmetric and asymmetric Full Conformal Prediction approaches for constructing Prediction Intervals.
